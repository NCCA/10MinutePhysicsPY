# Cannonball 3D

This is a basic conversion of the Three.js demo to QtQuick3D, not all features are available by default, however a most can be implemented.

The File [Scene.qml](Scene.qml) implements most of the 3D world and objects as well as the Buttons.

[02-Cannonball3D.py](02-Cannonball3D.py) has the main simulation code and then sends the updates to the QML file.
