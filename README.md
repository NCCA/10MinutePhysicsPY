# 10 Minute Physics in Python

This repository is my version of the [10 Minute Physics](https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/tenMinutePhysics/index.html) demos written in Python. The 2D demos use PySide6 for the Canvas, the 3D demos will use PySide6 and WebGPU.

Each folder has a link to a README.md file with the original demo link as well as descriptions of my versions of it.
